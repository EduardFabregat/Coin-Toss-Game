# Coin-Toss-Game

Exercise with a coin tossing game. The rules state that when the toss is heads the player gets 1 point, and when the toss is tails the player multiplies by 2 the score. The script calculates the expected result after tossing the coin 5, 10 and 15 times. The script also calculates the expected result of tossing a coin that falls heads two thirds of the time.
